# Week 8: Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

## 📘 Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate basic data analysis and visualization skills using the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries in Python. The assignment focuses on loading a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key insights.

## 📂 Files Included

- `week8_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `dataset.csv` — The dataset used for analysis (e.g., Iris dataset or custom dataset).
- `plot.png` — Example saved plot from the analysis (optional).
- `README.md` — This file.

## 📌 Tasks Performed

### 🔹 Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

- Loaded dataset using `pandas`.
- Displayed first few rows using `.head()`.
- Checked data types and missing values.
- Cleaned dataset by dropping or filling missing values.

### 🔹 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

- Computed basic statistics (mean, median, std).
- Grouped data by a categorical column to analyze numerical trends.
- Identified patterns and insights.

### 🔹 Task 3: Data Visualization

Created the following visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:

- 📈 Line Chart — showing trends over time.
- 📊 Bar Chart — comparing numerical values across categories.
- 📉 Histogram — displaying distribution of numerical columns.
- ⚫ Scatter Plot — visualizing the relationship between two numerical columns.

All plots include titles, labels, and legends where appropriate.
